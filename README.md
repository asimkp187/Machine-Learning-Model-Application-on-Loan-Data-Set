# Machine-Learning-Model-Application-on-Loan-Data-Set
A data science project applying machine learning models to predict loan approval outcomes based on applicant financial and demographic data. Includes data pre-processing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and performance comparison

üìä Project Overview

  This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict loan approval status. The process includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and model comparison to identify the best-performing classifier.

üìà Key Highlights

  ‚Ä¢ Cleaned and preprocessed raw loan dataset

  ‚Ä¢ Identified key predictors of loan approval

  ‚Ä¢ Compared multiple classification models
  
  ‚Ä¢ Improved accuracy through feature optimization

üßæ Conclusion

  ‚Ä¢ Built robust ML models for predicting loan eligibility
  
  ‚Ä¢ Demonstrated end-to-end workflow from raw data to model evaluation
